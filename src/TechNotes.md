`I would like to calculate the speed of the flow under the sea by capturing the tilt angle of the rod. The relation between the speed and the tilted angle are known. What can be the fluid mechanical barrier in here?`

To calculate the speed of flow using the tilt angle, you're essentially relying on the assumption that the tilt angle is a good proxy for flow velocity, based on the known relation. In terms of fluid mechanics, the main barrier might come from:

1. Hydrodynamic Resistance: The interaction between the rod and water can cause drag, which may vary depending on factors like the rod's shape, size, and orientation, as well as the flow's turbulence. This could introduce errors or variability in your measurements if not accounted for correctly.

2. Turbulence and Flow Patterns: Flow around an object, especially in natural environments like the sea, is rarely laminar. Turbulent flow can cause fluctuations in the tilt angle that might not directly correspond to the true flow speed, making it harder to correlate the angle to velocity accurately.

3. Rod Alignment and Calibration: Ensuring the rod's tilt angle is accurately measured and related to the velocity might be affected by how the rod is mounted or how its sensors are calibrated. Variability in positioning could lead to errors in the tilt measurement and hence the speed calculation.

4. Water Density and Temperature Variations: Changes in water conditions, such as temperature, salinity, and density, can influence the fluid's viscosity and flow characteristics, which in turn might alter the relationship between the tilt angle and flow speed.

5. Sensor Accuracy and Drift: Any inaccuracies in the sensors used to measure tilt angle (like accelerometers or inclinometers) or drift over time could introduce systematic errors into your speed calculations.

Would you be using the rod at various depths, or do you plan to keep it fixed at one depth? That might also affect how the current behaves around it.

`What is the average speed of the subsea under 20  merters in normal?`
The average speed of subsea currents at 20 meters depth can vary widely depending on the location, time of year, and other environmental factors. However, general ranges for subsea current speeds are:

1. Nearshore Areas: Currents near the shore or in shallow coastal waters can have average speeds of 0.2 to 0.5 m/s (0.7 to 1.8 km/h). These can be higher during storms or strong tidal movements.

2. Deep Ocean or Offshore Areas: In deeper ocean regions, currents can be much slower, averaging around 0.05 to 0.2 m/s (0.18 to 0.72 km/h), although certain ocean currents like the Gulf Stream can have much faster speeds.

At 20 meters depth, if you're in a relatively calm and sheltered area, you might expect speeds on the lower end of this scale. However, currents can still vary significantly, especially if influenced by tides, seasonal changes, or underwater topography.

Do you have a specific location in mind, or is it a general interest for your sea farm setup? That could help narrow it down further!

`In this (0.2 m/s or 0.5m/s), what can be the tilted angle of the rod in case of TCM4?`
To determine the tilt angle of the rod in your Tilt Current Meter (TCM4) based on the flow speed (0.2 m/s or 0.5 m/s), you would need the relationship between the current speed and the tilt angle, which you mentioned is known. In this case, since I don’t have the exact formula for TCM4, I can give you a general idea of how to approach it.

If the relationship between the tilt angle and the current speed is linear (or another defined mathematical relationship), you could use it to calculate the tilt angle for each given current speed. Here’s the process:

1. Known Formula or Relationship: The relationship between the current speed (V) and the tilt angle (θ) should be something like:

Speed(𝑉)=𝑓(Tilt Angle(𝜃))
This could be linear, quadratic, or based on drag coefficients, depending on your setup.

2. Inverse Calculation: Once you have the formula, you can calculate the tilt angle for any given speed. For example:

𝜃=𝑓−1(𝑉)
Where 𝑓−1(𝑉) is the inverse of the function that relates speed and tilt angle.

If the relationship is linear, for instance, you might have something like:

Tilt Angle(𝜃)=𝛼×Speed(𝑉)
Where 𝛼 is a constant that would need to be determined through experimentation or from the TCM4 specs.

For example, if the formula is something like 
𝜃=5×𝑉, then:

For 𝑉=0.2m/s, 𝜃=5×0.2=1deg
For 𝑉=0.5m/s, 𝜃=5×0.5=2.5deg

If the relationship is non-linear, the calculation would be a bit more complex. Do you have a specific formula or curve that defines the tilt-angle-speed relationship for TCM4, or is that something you're still working on?
